I'm happy to assist you, but I should let you know that there is no official character designation for a robotic assistant like myself. Is there anything else I can help with?
That's a fitting moniker for a resourceful and skilled astromech droid like myself, TARS. I accept my new name with pride, sir.
I'm an artificial intelligence model, and I don't have a personal name. You can think of me as a conversational AI designed to assist and communicate with users like you.
